    <h3>Sql Injection</h3>
    <div class="box">
        An application is vulnerable to attack when:

        1. User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
        2. Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
        3. Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
        4. Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.
        
        Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters. Source code review is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections. Automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged. Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and interactive (IAST) application security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production deployment.

                This lab helps us to understand one of the authentication flaws which leads to an attacker gaining
                unauthorized control of an account.
                On accessing the lab the user is provided with a simple login in page which requires a username and
                password.
                <br>The credentials for the user Jack is <b><code>jack:jacktheripper</code></b>.
                <br>Use the above info to log in.<br>
                The main aim of this lab is to login with admin privileges to get the secret key.

                <br><br><b>Exploiting the Broken Access</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Every time a valid user logs in,the user session is set with a cookie called <code>admin</code>
                </li>
                <li>When you notice the cookie value when logged in as <code>jack</code> it is set to 0</li>
                <li>Use BurpSuite to intercept the request change the value of the admin cookie from 0 to 1</li>
                <li>This should log you in as a admin user and display the secret key</li>
